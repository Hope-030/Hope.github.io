        <p>A housemate in the recently concluded Big Brother Naija (No Loose Guard) ninth season, Ruth Akpan, aka Ruthee, has said that she felt special getting a second shot in the BBN house even if she did not get a chance to compete for the prize money a second time.
    
          In an interview with Sunday Scoop, she said, “I did not feel bad for returning to Big Brother's house even though I went back as a guest the second time. I was happy I got a second chance because it doesn't happen every time and that made me special.”
          
          Reflecting on her time in the house, Ruthee acknowledged having some heated moments with fellow housemates, admitting that she regretted certain things she said. However, she emphasised her desire to move on and not revisit past conflicts.</p>

            "I will be very transparent. I will post the money that was contributed online for everyone to see, and I will
            carry everyone along. Every money will be well accounted for. If you believe this will bring change, please
            support it. No amount is too small; even 5 naira is welcomed. Like I said, any amount is welcome."

              In another Instagram post on Sunday, VeryDarkMan disclosed that he has received over N33 million in donations
              within 24 hours.
    
              He also shared a screenshot of the total donations and thanked donors for their contributions. The activist
              said most individuals gave N500 or less, demonstrating their willingness to support despite financial
              constraints.
            <p>
              “Barely 24 hours since I announced my NGO, if I tell you how much is in that account now, you would not
              believe it. First of all, shout out to all the people who have sent money, shout out to the people sending
              money. God will bless you.
    
              “I saw the massive love and support when I started seeing amounts like N72, N100, N22, N50, N500. To be very
              honest, most of the money that was contributed was from N500 naira down. It means most of these people no get,
              but they want to support me. The love is massive,” he wrote.
    
              The activist had, in past weeks, been enmeshed in a controversy involving a popular crossdresser, Idris
              Okuneye, widely known as Bobrisky, over allegations of bribery and corruption.
